## Features ‚ú®
- **AI-Powered Gameplay**: The GNN model suggests optimal moves during gameplay, making it a formidable opponent.
- **Interactive UI**: The game features an interactive interface built with `ipywidgets` for seamless user interaction.
- **Model-Driven Decisions**: The AI makes move decisions based on the current state of the board, using a pre-trained GNN model.


##Graph Neural Network (GNN) Overview üß†
A Graph Neural Network (GNN) is a deep learning model tailored for graph-structured data, where entities (nodes) and their relationships (edges) are central.

### How It Works:
#### Nodes and Edges: Nodes represent entities, and edges represent their connections.
#### Message Passing: Nodes exchange information with their neighbors to update their features, capturing the graph's structure.
#### Graph Convolution: Like CNNs, GNNs aggregate neighbor information to update node embeddings.
#### Prediction: Final node embeddings are used to make decisions or predictions.

In Tic Tac Toe:
The GNN represents the board as a graph, analyzes connections between moves, and suggests the optimal next move based on the current game state.

## Deployments üåê

The TicTacToe-GNN project can be deployed locally:

### Local Version
- Runs directly in a Jupyter Notebook.
- Interactive UI built using `ipywidgets` for an engaging gameplay experience.
- Also deployed in huggingface

## Example Gameplay üß™

- **Starting the Game**: Simply run the notebook to start a new game. The AI will suggest moves for the 'O' player.
- **Player vs AI**: Take turns with the AI to see if you can outsmart the GNN-powered opponent.

## Future Development üöÄ

- **Enhanced AI**: Further refine the GNN model to improve move prediction accuracy.
- **Additional Modes**: Introduce different difficulty levels and game modes, such as Player vs Player and AI vs AI.
